<p>I once read an insightful piece that highlighted how people are 90% more likely to purchase a product or service if it comes recommended by a friend. This statistic sparked an innovative idea in my mind, leading to the creation of "Refery." The concept was simple yet revolutionary: Why not reward individuals for sharing advertisements?</p>
<h5 node="[object Object]">Existing Strategies</h5>
<p>The realm of marketing has long been familiar with influencer, affiliate, and referral marketing strategies. However, Refery was set to stand apart from these traditional approaches.</p>
<h6 node="[object Object]">Influencer Marketing</h6>
<p>Influencer Marketing capitalizes on the trust we place in our idols. Nonetheless, it predominantly targets celebrities or individuals with massive followings, overlooking the average person. But whom do we trust more than anyone? Precisely, our friends and family. This is where Refery bridges the gap, making every individual a potential influencer within their own circle.</p>
<h6 node="[object Object]">Affiliate Marketing</h6>
<p>Affiliate Marketing, on the other hand, demands considerable effort from affiliates. It often involves setting up intricate online stores and reselling products, resembling more of a side hustle. Refery simplifies this process, requiring just a few clicks to share and earn, eliminating the need for extensive setups.</p>
<h6 node="[object Object]">Referral Marketing</h6>
<p>Referral Marketing comes closest to the essence of Refery, thus inspiring its name. However, traditional referral programs typically offer rewards such as discounts, platform credits, or free subscriptions rather than real money. Additionally, these campaigns are confined to the company's existing customer base, limiting their reach. Refery innovates by offering real monetary rewards and opening up the campaigns to a broader audience.</p>
<h6 node="[object Object]">Commissions</h6>
<p>One significant advantage for companies partnering with Refery is the versatility in commission offerings. Unlike traditional models restricted to purchase-based commissions, Refery allows for commissions on a wide array of actions, including downloads, survey completions, sign-ups, and more.</p>
<h5 node="[object Object]">Result</h5>
<p>Motivated by this idea, I dedicated over 400 hours across approximately six months to develop Refery. The project has since grown into a substantial codebase, amassing over 30,000 lines of code. It stands as one of my most significant and challenging projects to date, embodying a unique blend of innovation, simplicity, and inclusivity in the digital marketing landscape.</p></div><h3>KeyTap</h3><p>Start<!-- -->: <!-- -->2022<!-- --> <br>Platform<!-- -->: <!-- -->Web<!-- --> <br>Description<!-- -->: <!-- -->Learn & Train Keyboard Shortcuts<!-- --> <br></p><div><a href="https://www.keytap.app">Website</a><a href="https://www.keytap.app/download">Download</a><h4 node="[object Object]">About</h4>
<h5 node="[object Object]">The Spark of Innovation</h5>
<p>I've always been deeply passionate about boosting productivity and enhancing the speed of my work. This drive led me to switch from Visual Studio Code to Vim a few years ago. Vim, known for its plethora of keyboard shortcuts, was an eye-opener for me. I marveled at how these shortcuts could significantly streamline my workflow, making me a staunch advocate for Vim. The only drawback? The steep learning curve associated with mastering these shortcuts, which I found frustratingly time-consuming.</p>
<h5 node="[object Object]">The Birth of KeyTap</h5>
<p>It was this blend of admiration and frustration that sparked the idea for <strong>KeyTap</strong>. I envisioned KeyTap as an interactive tool to demystify the world of keyboard shortcuts, making them accessible and easier to learn for everyone. Driven by this vision, I dedicated approximately six months to coding KeyTap from the ground up.</p>
<h5 node="[object Object]">Achievements and Milestones</h5>
<p>After countless hours of coding, KeyTap evolved into a comprehensive platform boasting over 15,000 lines of code. It now supports 21 different applications, encompasses 199 meticulously crafted lessons, and introduces users to over 3,000 keyboard shortcuts. Our proudest achievement to date?

<h5 node="[object Object]">Looking Forward</h5>
<p>KeyTap's journey from a simple idea to a robust platform is a testament to the power of innovation and perseverance. As we continue to expand our lessons and support for more applications, our mission remains the same: to make productivity tools like keyboard shortcuts universally accessible and easy to master. Join us on this journey to unlock your full potential and transform the way you work.</p></div><h3>Remark</h3><p>Start<!-- -->: <!-- -->2021<!-- --> <br>Platform<!-- -->: <!-- -->Extension<!-- --> <br>Description<!-- -->: <!-- -->Uncensored Comments, anywhere<!-- --> <br></p><div><a href="https://www.remark.surf">Website</a><a href="https://github.com/simplifylabs/remark">GitHub</a><h4 node="[object Object]">About</h4>
<p>Once, after sharing my thoughts under a YouTube video, I encountered a challenging situation. The channel owner, holding a different opinion, decided to delete my comments. Persistent attempts to repost were futile; my comments were consistently removed, and some of my words even ended up on the channel's comment filter blacklist.</p>
<p>Frustrated by this restriction on free speech, I was compelled to find a solution. It dawned on me that a browser extension could elegantly address this issue by creating an independent comment system. This system would store comments in a separate database, inaccessible even to website owners. But as I delved deeper, I realized the benefits extended far beyond just uncensored speech.</p>
<h5 node="[object Object]">Uncensored</h5>
<p>The cornerstone of Remark is its commitment to free speech. Comments posted using Remark remain untouched, unless they violate our terms of service by being racist or similarly offensive. This foundational principle ensures that everyone's voice can be heard.</p>
<h5 node="[object Object]">Better</h5>
<p>Remark isn't just about uncensoring; it enhances the commenting experience. With features like replies, mentions, upvotes, and downvotes, it brings a rich, interactive dynamic to online discussions. Our voting system ensures that the most valuable comments rise to the top, fostering a community-driven approach to content curation.</p>
<h5 node="[object Object]">Anywhere</h5>
<p>Remark redefines the boundaries of commenting. It empowers users to leave comments on any site, regardless of whether it has its own comment system. This universal capability, paired with the convenience of a single account for all interactions, opens new avenues for online engagement.</p>
<h5 node="[object Object]">Results</h5>
<p>Remark has grown to over 10,000 lines of code, becoming one of my most cherished projects. It supports nearly all common browsers, embodying my vision of a more open and interactive internet.</p>
<p>This journey from a frustrating encounter on YouTube to the creation of Remark underscores my dedication to free speech and innovation. It's a testament to the power of technology in overcoming barriers and bringing people together, one comment at a time.</p></div><h3>PortfolioOS</h3><p>Start<!-- -->: <!-- -->2024<!-- --> <br>Platform<!-- -->: <!-- -->Website<!-- --> <br>Description<!-- -->: <!-- -->The site you're currently looking at<!-- --> <br></p><div><a href="https://poeck.gumroad.com/l/portfolio-os">Template</a><a href="https://paul.koeck.dev">Website</a><h4 node="[object Object]">About</h4>
<h5 node="[object Object]">The Beginning</h5>
<p>Like every other developer out there, I needed a portfolio website. I first had the idea of making my portfolio in the style of a Terminal, which I then also did.

<h5 node="[object Object]">Seeking Innovation</h5>
<p>However, as time passed, the desire for innovation grew within me. I yearned for something new, something that would not only capture the essence of my initial idea but expand it into an even more immersive experience. That's when the idea struck me - why not create not just a "fake" terminal but an entire operating system? The thought was ambitious, and I knew it would be a challenge unlike any I had faced before.</p>
<p>I embarked on this ambitious project, which I named PortfolioOS, about two years ago. It was a venture into uncharted territory, an attempt to blend the boundaries between a portfolio and an interactive user experience. However, life and other projects demanded my attention, and I reluctantly had to pause the development of PortfolioOS.</p>
<h5 node="[object Object]">A New Dawn</h5>
<p>Fast forward to 2024, a year of new beginnings and renewed determination. I finally took up the project again, pouring my passion and creativity into making PortfolioOS not just a reality, but an experience that would stand out. The development process was intense, filled with learning and overcoming obstacles. Just before I was about to finalize the project, curiosity led me to explore whether anyone else had embarked on a similar journey.</p>
<p>That's when I discovered <a href="https://dustinbrett.com/" node="[object Object]">Dustin Brett's Portfolio</a>. His project was nothing short of incredible, a testament to creativity and technical skill. It was more fascinating than anything I had envisioned. However, instead of viewing this discovery as a setback, I saw it as a source of inspiration.

<p>📁 <strong>Get Unique File Names</strong>: Forget about spending time thinking up new file names to avoid duplication. Uniquer automatically generates a unique file name for each set of data, simplifying file management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🧹 <strong>Keep It Clean</strong>: A clean file system is a happy file system. With no duplicates and fewer files to manage, your directories stay organized and clutter-free.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 node="[object Object]">How It Works</h5>
<p>Uniquer employs a straightforward yet effective mechanism to ensure file uniqueness:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the SHA256 hash of the passed data, ensuring a unique identifier for each file content.</li>
<li>Generate the file name by appending the appropriate file extension to the hash.</li>
<li>Before creating a new file, check if a file with the generated name already exists.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>If not, the file is created.</li>
<li>If yes, no action is taken, avoiding duplicate file creation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process guarantees that for any given set of data, only one file is created and stored. If you attempt to write the same data multiple times, Uniquer will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write the data only once.</li>
<li>Create only a single file.</li>
</ul>
<p>With SHA256 hash function's reliability, there's no need to worry about duplicate file names. The chances of a hash collision are astronomically low, ensuring that each file name is as unique as the data it represents.</p>
<h5 node="[object Object]">Collision-Free Assurance</h5>
<p>The uniqueness offered by Uniquer is backed by the robust SHA256 hashing algorithm, which has never encountered a collision. This means that every piece of data processed by Uniquer is guaranteed to have a distinct file name, ensuring the utmost efficiency in file management and storage.</p>
<p>Uniquer is not just a tool; it's a new way of thinking about how we store and manage files, ensuring efficiency, cleanliness, and uniqueness at every step of the way.</p></div><h3>Love Packager</h3><p>Start<!-- -->: <!-- -->2022<!-- --> <br>Platform<!-- -->: <!-- -->CLI<!-- --> <br>Description<!-- -->: <!-- -->CLI to package your LÖVE projects<!-- --> <br></p><div><a href="https://github.com/simplifylabs/love-packager">GitHub</a><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/love-packager">NPM</a><h4 node="[object Object]">About</h4>

Here's a brief journey through my coding adventure and the milestones along the way.\n\n## The Spark of Interest\n\nWhen I was just 12 years old, my brother [Simon Koeck](https://simon.koeck.dev) introduced me to the world of coding at the [Code Base Camp](https://www.code-base.at/!). There, I wrote my first line of code, delving into HTML \u0026 CSS. Although I took a brief hiatus from coding to immerse myself in video games, one game, [Welcome to the Game II](https://store.steampowered.com/app/720250/Welcome_to_the_Game_II/!), reignited my passion. Inspired by its hacking theme, I decided to create a similar game. My dedication led me to complete the project during a [Ludum Dare Game Jam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/cr4ck-launcher!), despite the steep learning curve with C# and Unity.\n\n[![Crack Launcher](/screenshots/crack.png)](#crack)\n\n## From Games to Apps\n\nMy journey didn't stop at game development. The next venture was [Frags](#frags), a mobile app designed to extend keyboard functionality through custom macro keys. Transitioning from Unity to Dart and Flutter, I dedicated countless hours to this project. The app's popularity soared unexpectedly, thanks to a feature by [Cinecom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4ySShjYdeQ!) on YouTube, leading to over **15,000 downloads**.\n\n[![Frags](/screenshots/frags.png)](#frags)\n\n## Diving into Freelancing\n\nEncouraged by my initial projects, I ventured into freelancing on [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/paulkoeck) in 2021. My first client was [TraderEdge](#traderedge), marking my deep dive into web development. Although we planned to launch [FoxFunding](#foxfunding-archive), the success of TraderEdge shifted our focus, and FoxFunding was archived [here](#foxfunding-archive). Around this time, I also embarked on creating a desktop app for [Live! Casino Hotel Maryland](https://maryland.livecasinohotel.com/!), which turned into a series of seven successful desktop app projects for the casino.\n\n[![Böller Architektur](/screenshots/boeller.png)](#boeller)\n\n## Expanding My Horizon\n\nBetween 2021 and 2022, I undertook numerous freelance projects, maintaining an average of 4.9 stars over 16 reviews on Fiverr. My last freelance project was [Spaceping](#spaceping), a testament to my growing expertise and creativity in app development.\n\n[![Spaceping](/screenshots/spaceping.png)](#spaceping)\n\n## Personal Projects\n\nMy journey didn't stop with freelance work. I've since launched significant personal projects like [Remark](#remark), [KeyTap](#keytap), and [Refery](#refery), alongside smaller side projects which you can find in the [projects folder](#projects).\n\n[![Refery](/screenshots/refery.png)](#refery)\n\n[![KeyTap](/screenshots/keytap.png)](#keytap)\n\n[![Remark](/screenshots/remark.png)](#remark)"},{"type":"email","id":"contact","name":"Contact Me","email":"paul@koeck.dev","subject":"Contact request from Portfolio","window":{"width":400,"height":520},"fields":{"subject":false},"placeholders":{"body":"Hi Paul,\n..."}},{"id":"template","type":"link","url":"https://poeck.gumroad.com/l/portfolio-os?ref=paul.koeck.dev","name":"Template","icon":"/icons/portfolio.svg"},{"type":"folder","id":"projects","name":"Projects","list":true,"window":{"width":800,"height":600},"columns":[{"name":"Name"},{"start":"Start"},{"platform":"Platform"},{"description":"Description","mobile":false}],"apps":[{"type":"folder","id":"jokedial","name":"JokeDial","icon":"/icons/jokedial.svg","start":2024,"platform":"Web","description":"Prank Calls, powered by AI","apps":[{"type":"link","id":"jokedial-web","icon":"/icons/jokedial.svg","url":"https://jokedial.com/?ref=paul.koeck.dev","name":"Website"}]},{"type":"folder","id":"refery","name":"Refery","icon":"/icons/refery.svg","start":2023,"platform":"Mobile","description":"Find Ads, Share Links, Earn Money","apps":[{"type":"image","path":"/screenshots/refery.png","name":"Screenshot","id":"QP3vpmT5"},{"type":"folder","name":"Screenshots","apps":[{"type":"image","name":"Find Ads","path":"/screenshots/refery/find.png","id":"trg83yrO"},{"type":"image","name":"Share Links","path":"/screenshots/refery/share.png","id":"HvyW5uxb"},{"type":"image","name":"Earn Money","path":"/screenshots/refery/earn.png","id":"IGsrFNgP"},{"type":"image","name":"Refery Hub","path":"/screenshots/refery/hub.png","id":"BKR208qr"}],"id":"m33pBwjm"},{"type":"link","id":"refery-web","icon":"/icons/refery.svg","url":"https://www.refery.net","name":"Website"},{"type":"link","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.refery","name":"Play Store","external":true,"id":"SgTKj-FK"},{"type":"markdown","name":"About","content":"# About\n\nI once read an insightful piece that highlighted how people are 90% more likely to purchase a product or service if it comes recommended by a friend. This statistic sparked an innovative idea in my mind, leading to the creation of \"Refery.\" The concept was simple yet revolutionary: Why not reward individuals for sharing advertisements?\n\n## Existing Strategies\n\nThe realm of marketing has long been familiar with influencer, affiliate, and referral marketing strategies. However, Refery was set to stand apart from these traditional approaches.\n\n### Influencer Marketing\n\nInfluencer Marketing capitalizes on the trust we place in our idols. Nonetheless, it predominantly targets celebrities or individuals with massive followings, overlooking the average person. But whom do we trust more than anyone? Precisely, our friends and family. This is where Refery bridges the gap, making every individual a potential influencer within their own circle.\n\n### Affiliate Marketing\n\nAffiliate Marketing, on the other hand, demands considerable effort from affiliates. It often involves setting up intricate online stores and reselling products, resembling more of a side hustle. Refery simplifies this process, requiring just a few clicks to share and earn, eliminating the need for extensive setups.\n\n### Referral Marketing\n\nReferral Marketing comes closest to the essence of Refery, thus inspiring its name. However, traditional referral programs typically offer rewards such as discounts, platform credits, or free subscriptions rather than real money. Additionally, these campaigns are confined to the company's existing customer base, limiting their reach. Refery innovates by offering real monetary rewards and opening up the campaigns to a broader audience.\n\n### Commissions\n\nOne significant advantage for companies partnering with Refery is the versatility in commission offerings. Unlike traditional models restricted to purchase-based commissions, Refery allows for commissions on a wide array of actions, including downloads, survey completions, sign-ups, and more.\n\n## Result\n\nMotivated by this idea, I dedicated over 400 hours across approximately six months to develop Refery. The project has since grown into a substantial codebase, amassing over 30,000 lines of code.

In a serendipitous twist, I discovered that Minimal Browser adeptly bypassed the school's security systems. This feature, albeit unintended, made it a popular tool among students. It turned into the go-to solution for accessing entertainment and leisure websites, such as video game portals and YouTube, circumventing the restrictions imposed by the school's network.\n\nThe revelation of this capability led to Minimal Browser being downloaded thousands of times by students, eager to explore the vastness of the web unrestricted during their school hours. This unexpected utility of the browser highlighted the unforeseen impacts technology can have, transcending its original purpose and scope.\n\n## A Companion Project: Minimal Editor\n\nIn the spirit of minimalism and simplicity, another project that paralleled the development of Minimal Browser was **[Minimal Editor](#editor)**. This project is a testament to the beauty of minimalistic design, offering a straightforward and clutter-free text editing experience. Just as Minimal Browser simplifies web browsing, Minimal Editor encapsulates the essence of text editing in its most basic form.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe journey of developing Minimal Browser has been both enlightening and unexpected. It served not only as a learning experience in using ElectronJS and creating desktop applications but also as a reminder of the unpredictable ways in which technology can evolve and influence our daily lives. Minimal Browser, with its simple yet effective functionality, underscores my belief in the power of minimalism and the importance of learning through doing.","id":"bS1iXuW9"}]},{"type":"folder","name":"Tisis School","icon":"/icons/vstisis.svg","start":2021,"platform":"Website","description":"Homepage of a Primary School","apps":[{"type":"image","id":"tisis-screenshot","name":"Screenshot","window":{"width":700,"height":635,"fullscreen":true},"path":"/screenshots/vstisis.jpg"},{"type":"markdown","name":"About","content":"# About\n\n## Introduction\n\nThroughout my journey in technology and entrepreneurship, I have always sought opportunities to blend innovation with public service. This drive led me to contribute to a project that holds a special place in my portfolio - the \"Public Service\" project. Initiated as a school project, it provided me with a unique opportunity to apply my coding skills for a noble cause.\n\n## Choosing My Path\n\nWhen presented with the freedom to choose our contributions to the \"Public Service\" project, I gravitated towards what I do best - coding. This decision opened the door to a collaboration that not only challenged me but also promised to make a significant impact on a local community.\n\n## Collaboration with a Primary School\n\nEager to make a meaningful contribution, I reached out to the headmaster of a nearby Primary School. The prospect of providing the school with a free website was met with enthusiasm and excitement. It was a perfect match; my passion for coding and the school's need for a digital presence. Unfortunately, the headmaster's departure from the school led to the project's premature conclusion, with the website never seeing the light of day online.\n\n## A Glimpse into What Could Have Been\n\nDespite the unforeseen halt, the work on the \"Public Service\" project remains a testament to the potential impact of technology in education and community service. For those interested, a small screenshot of the project can be viewed [here](#tisis-screenshot). It represents not only what was achieved but also what could have been, serving as a reminder of the importance of perseverance and flexibility in the face of challenges.\n\n## Reflections\n\nThe journey of the \"Public Service\" project, although not culminating in a live website, has been invaluable. It taught me the significance of initiative, collaboration, and adaptability. These experiences continue to shape my approach to technology and entrepreneurship, fueling my drive to create solutions that serve the community.\n\nI invite you to explore more about my projects and the impact they aim to create.
